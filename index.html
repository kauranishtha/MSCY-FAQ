<p><b>27. What are the career opportunities after MSCY?</b></p>

<p>There are abundant opportunities in the field of Cybersecurity and having a Master's degree in the same makes out stand out in the crowd. The Co-op program at Northeastern is an extremely helpful way to get a full-time job post-graduation. For most students, their Co-op/internship gets converted into a full-time role. </p>

<p>Within MSCY, student gets an opportunity to choose your sub-field of interest. There are various options you can choose based on your interest. Please refer to the following NIST document to find more about career opportunities in Information Security: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework">https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework</a></p>

<p>Apart from Co-op program, the University conducts a Career Fair each semester in order to bring in employers from numerous industries for a face-to-face interaction with students. Students in the past have acquired great jobs through career fair. Northeastern's Career Development center is very active in getting employers from companies like Facebook, Apple, Raytheon and alike on the campus for information sessions and interviews. Please explore our Career Development website where you can learn everything you need to know about getting a job in US:</p>

<p><b>28. How should I decide which career path to take in cybersecurity?</b></p>

<p>This totally depends on your interests, skill set you have and you are willing to build during the course of this programs. Please take a look at the link below which gives a good about various career options in cybersecurity and required skill set: </p>

<p><a href="http://cyberseek.org/pathway.html">http://cyberseek.org/pathway.html</a></p>

<p><b>29. What are Co-ops? How to get one? And what are the benefits of doing a Co-op? </b></p>

<p>Co-op stands for Cooperative Education Experience which is essentially an opportunity to work for 6-8 months full-time (i.e., using one full semester for doing a co-op instead of talking courses). For international students, this work experience will be counted under their CPT time. Co-ops are different from internship such that an internship is a 2-4 months long work experience whereas a Co-op can be 6-8 months long. During a co-op, a student generally does not enroll for any full-time courses but there is an option to opt for a course in the second half of the co-op. </p>

<p>The process of finding a co-op works in a similar way as finding any other job. Northeastern University has its own database called NU Careers where job posting for Co-ops are listed and students can apply. Students are also allowed to find a co-op from other sources as well such as LinkedIn and other job boards. The professors at University and alumni are also quite resourceful while looking for co-ops. CCIS provides a “Co-op Experience” class in first semester which helps students to prepare for their upcoming co-op search process and how to approach it. </p>

<p>Co-ops are extremely beneficial as most of the times, students are offered full-time jobs after the completion of their co-op. It helps to understand the practical application of concepts taught in the courses in MSCY. For international students, co-op work experience helps them to get acquainted with American work culture. Generally, it is seen that once the students complete their co-op, they can streamline their interests more easily and then carve their career path accordingly. </p>

<p><b>34. I received an email from the university today regarding the discounted pass for MBTA, is it really worth it?</b></p>

<p>Whether the MBTA monthly pass worth it depends on where you live. Students who live near the subway stations and far from the college find the monthly pass useful, especially if they go to the campus often. If you buy the pass through the school before a semester starts, you will get 11% off. The details for the same can be asked by sending an email to <a href="mailto:parking@northeastern.edu">parking@northeastern.edu</a>.</p>

<p><b>35. What is a Capstone Project?</b></p>

<p>In a capstone project, students will work on a cybersecurity project provided by a company. Students can reach out companies for projects themselves or industry partners of the college would provide projects for students to choose from. A group a students work together on a project (online or on campus) and provide a research report or a presentation (or both) at the end of the course. During the course, the instructor would follow up with teams' progress and answer questions.</p>

<p><b>36. What level of knowledge of computer programming do you need to start the program? Or is it something you acquire along the way? </b></p>

<p>The program accepts students from wide variety of academic and professional backgrounds. There are many courses where knowledge about Python will come in handy. However, we offer a cyberspace programming course, IA 5040, for students who do not have previous knowledge about programming. Although, the programming skill will be helpful, but the program does not require deep programing knowledge. </p>

<p><b>37. What makes a Cyber Security program at Northeastern stand out from all the rest and can you tell me a little bit about the program?</b></p>

<p>The course structure, instructors and Co-op program really make the program stand out. The program provides a wide range of courses for students to choose from. The courses cover different fields in Cybersecurity: computer system security, network security, software security, risk analysis, forensics, cryptographic and etc. Students can choose classes based on their interest and career plans.</p>
